# TCG Price Comparator (eBay vs TCG Player or Price Charting)

This is a GUI-based Python tool for comparing **TCG (Trading Card Game)** listings on **eBay** (like Pok√©mon, Yu-Gi-Oh, Magic: The Gathering) against **PriceCharting** market values. It helps users identify potentially undervalued cards on eBay based on current auction or buy-now listings.

## üì¶ How It Works

1. **eBay Listings**:
   - Uses the official eBay Browse API to get current auctions or fixed-price listings.

2. **Market Price Lookup**:
   - Parses the card title to extract key identifiers (e.g., `"Charizard PSA 9"`).
   - Uses **SerpAPI** to Google search for the matching **PriceCharting** product page.
   - Scrapes the market price using **headless Selenium**.

3. **Profit Calculation**:
   - Compares the total eBay cost (bid + shipping) with the PriceCharting market value.
   - Displays the difference as a **profit/loss column**.

## üß† Intelligent Title Parsing

To ensure better PriceCharting accuracy, the tool:
- Extracts up to the first 3 capitalized keywords from the eBay title
- Prioritizes recognized grades like **PSA**, **BGS**, **CGC**, etc.
- Ignores noise words like "Near Mint", "Holo", "Foil", etc. in searches

---

## üñ±Ô∏è UI Interaction

- **Double-click** on:
  - The **eBay URL** column to open the listing
  - The **PriceCharting Link** column to view the price data page

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Notes

- **This tool is intended for TCG cards** (e.g., Pok√©mon, Yu-Gi-Oh, MTG). Accuracy for sports or other collectibles may be reduced.
- Scraping PriceCharting is done responsibly and with rate-limiting via Selenium and threading.
- You should comply with eBay and PriceCharting's terms of service when using this tool.
